# Customized Denon Prime 4 Firmware

This repository contains the efforts done to create and flash custom firmware for the Denon Prime 4. This may also be relevant to other Denon DJ equipment, however the main efforts are focused on the Denon Prime 4.

## Setup

Steps below have only been tested on an Arch Linux system. Basic development packages (for example `build-essentials` or `base-devel` package), u-boot tools and 7-zip are required to be installed on your system.

You will also need QEMU (specifically its ARM emulation) with it registered via binfmt to execute ARM binaries. On Arch Linux this would be covered by installing `qemu-user-static` and from AUR `binfmt-qemu-static` (you could also just write the config file `binfmt-qemu-static` installs yourself).

To reproduce the modified firmware with OpenSSH:

1. Run `./unpack.sh` to download and unpack the original firmware package.
2. Run `./clone-buildroot.sh` to download the matching buildroot environment via Git to the `buildroot/2021.02.10` directory.
3. Run `./compile-buildroot.sh` to build the required toolchain and packages in buildroot. Note that this will ask for sudo access to modify the unpacked firmware images via loopback mount.
4. Run `./pack.sh` to finally pack the modified image files back into a new firmware package. It will have a `.dtb` extension but you can rename this to `.img` and flash it directly to your hardware.
5. Optionally run `./unpack-updater.sh` to download Denon's original Windows tool for flashing firmware via USB cable, then run `./generate-updater-win.sh` to download 7-zip's SFX module to generate a self-extracting executable based on that tool but with your own image instead.

## Customizations

- Use `./mount.sh` to chroot into unpacked rootfs at any time.
- Use `./mount.sh --write` to chroot into rootfs without read-only flags set. Do your modifications and exit the shell, and it will be stored in the rootfs.
- You can pass any command to `./mount.sh` such as `(echo YourPassword123 && echo YourPassword123) | ./mount.sh --write passwd` for scripting.

## Information

### Buildroot

The rootfs seems to be built using Buildroot 2021.02.10 with the kernel version being `5.10.109-inmusic-2022-03-30-rt64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_RT Wed May 18 00:35:15 UTC 2022 armv7l GNU/Linux` at the time of writing this.

This repository makes use of that fact to build software in an easy manner.

### Firmware update source

The firmware pulls the latest firmware and its URL from https://autoupdate.airmusictech.com/PrimeUpdates.xml.

## Notes

These are just my own notes and findings in the original firmware.

- Root filesystem built with buildroot 2021.02.10 (apparently erroneously `git describe`'d in firmware as `2021.02.9-83-g1f864943a0`), so this is what I'm using for my modifications as well
- Incomplete list of pre-installed software on PRIME 4 firmware:
  - alsa-utils 1.2.4
  - busybox 1.33.2
  - bzip2 1.0.8
  - dfu-util 0.9
  - flac 1.3.3
  - kmod 29 +ZSTD +XZ +ZLIB +LIBCRYPTO -EXPERIMENTAL
  - lame 3.100
  - libcap 2.48
  - libexpat 1.8.4
  - libgpiod 1.6.3 with tools
  - libmali 14.0 (r1p0, without OpenCL)
  - libopenssl 1.1
  - libpng 16.37.0
  - libsamplerate 0.1.8
  - libzlib 1.2.11
  - mpg123 1.25.15
  - OpenSSL 1.1
  - pixz 1.0.7
  - Qt5 framework installed to /usr/qt and loaded via `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/qt/lib`
  - systemd 247 -PAM -AUDIT -SELINUX -IMA -APPARMOR -SMACK -SYSVINIT -UTMP -LIBCRYPTSETUP -GCRYPT +GNUTLS -ACL +XZ -LZ4 +ZSTD -SECCOMP +BLKID +ELFUTILS +KMOD -IDN2 -IDN -PCRE2 default-hierarchy=hybrid
  - xz/liblzma 5.2.5
  - zstd 1.4.9
  - â€¦?
- Engine
  - Installed in /usr/Engine
  - Referenced to as "Planck", specifically versioned as `Planck-1.2.1-3210-g1ab18eaa`
  - This is probably the Denon-internal project name for Engine/Engine OS
  - Seems to be built by [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io) and its build tag seems to be `jenkins-Planck-Embedded_Release-1188`
- SoundSwitch
  - Installed in /usr/SoundSwitch
  - Referenced to simply as "SoundSwitch", specifically version with git hash `0b20b3f96a`
- Customizations seem to have the "az01" prefix attached to file names or service names
- There is a reference to Akai MPC hardware which is the configuration's file path for the display brightness setting
- OS uses file system overlays for /etc and /var to redirect changes to /media/az01-internal/system/
- Credentials for streaming services are stored in /media/az01-internal/StreamingAccounts.json
  - Beatport LINK credentials specifically are just bare username and password
- At least on my device, an old firmware version from 2022-03-05 seems to be stored in /media/az01-internal/az01-update.img for some reason
- Engine app is its own systemd service (/etc/systemd/system/engine.service)
  - actually calls a wrapper script which does device-specific setup for performance, GPU drivers, initial device values etc.
  - Engine app itself is a Qt app called with above `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` hack
  - Engine app renders directly to framebuffer, no X or Wayland involved or even installed on the original firmware
  - Engine app also does the fade transition from boot logo (note the version number being displayed until Engine starts and it abruptly disappears) to the Engine UI
- Platters, controls, sliders, etc. all provided via MIDI to the internal system. Pretty much seems to be same thing as what is done in Computer-attached mode where it's MIDI via USB.
- Firmware update process checks the SHA-1 hashes provided for the xz-compressed images in the device tree blob. These are automatically reconstructed by my modification process.
